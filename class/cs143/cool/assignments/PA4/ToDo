1. Break code of install_classes
2. Appropriate error messages
3. Undefined classes/vriables/methods can lead to coredump
	if semantic analysis is carried even after detection of error.
	Handle all such conditions. Specially when lookup for class or lookup for
	attribute or lookup for method name is done.
